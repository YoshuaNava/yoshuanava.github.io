My name is **Yoshua Nava**. I am (almost) an Informatics Engineer from Universidad Catolica Andres Bello (UCAB), located in Caracas, Venezuela. My main dream and goal in life is to pursue a career in robotics research, in the fields of **optimal control theory** and **computer vision**.

In my free time I enjoy participating in MOOC's (Massive Open Online Courses), building robots and learning about robotics, studying mathematics, running, playing soccer, playing the guitar, hanging out with friends, and reading.
