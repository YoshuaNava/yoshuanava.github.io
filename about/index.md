**I am an Informatics Engineer from Universidad Catolica Andres Bello (UCAB)**, a higher-education institution located in Caracas, Venezuela. My main dream and goal in life is to pursue a career in robotics, doing translational research.

Among many topics in robotics, I'm specially interested in:

* <b>Computer vision</b>: visual SLAM, image oversegmentation and deep learning. 

* <b>Optimal control theory</b>: nonlinear systems analysis, trajectory optimization.

<br>

In my free time I enjoy participating in MOOC's (Massive Open Online Courses), building robots, studying mathematics, running, playing soccer, playing the guitar, hanging out with friends, and reading.

<br>
