			<p>I am (almost) an Informatics Engineer from Universidad Catolica Andres Bello (UCAB), located in Caracas, Venezuela. My main dream and goal in life is to pursue a career in robotics research, in the fields of <b>optimal control theory</b> and <b>computer vision</b>.</p>



			<p>In my free time I enjoy participating in MOOC's (Massive Open Online Courses), building robots and learning about robotics, studying mathematics, running, playing soccer, playing the guitar, hanging out with friends, and reading.</p>
