                    <p>I am an Informatics Engineer from Universidad Catolica Andres Bello, located in Caracas, Venezuela. During my studies I served as a teaching assistant for the course "Calculus I for engineering" for two and a half years, built robots with the robotics research group, and, for my (Bachellor) thesis, worked on developing a control algorithm for stabilizing a low-cost quadrotor platform.</p>

                    <p>My main dream and goal in life is to pursue a career in robotics research, in the fields of optimal control theory and computer vision.</p>
					<p>In my free time I enjoy running, playing soccer (That's the joy in life), studying mathematics, playing guitar, hanging out with friends, and reading a lot.</p>
