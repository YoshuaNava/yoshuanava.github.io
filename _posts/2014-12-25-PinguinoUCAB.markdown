As part of my mandatory communitary service I worked with the Educational Robotics Group at UCAB to implement a small set of 
<a href="http://pinguino.cc/">Pinguino control boards</a>. The Pinguino boards were choosen because their electronic components were 
easier to find in Venezuela.

Based on the requirements of the group, the <a href="https://github.com/PinguinoBase/Pinguino-Base-4550">Pinguino Base 4550 board</a>
was choosen to be the first prototype. We built one, tested it, and after that, we modified the circuit schematics to reduce costs by
decreasing its total size and removing the ICSP headers. The modified boards were called "PinguinoUCAB".

We wrote manuals for building and programming the boards, and recorded a video tutorial to describe the construction process so that 
the boards could be easily reproduced by the members of the Educational Robotics Group:
