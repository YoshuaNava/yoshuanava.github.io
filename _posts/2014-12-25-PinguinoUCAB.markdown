<h2> Overview </h2>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
As part of my mandatory communitary service I worked with Jonathan Teixeira, another student, and the Educational Robotics Group 
at UCAB to implement a small set of <a href="http://pinguino.cc/">Pinguino control boards</a>. The Pinguino boards were choosen 
because their electronic components could be found in the Venezuelan market.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Based on the requirements of the group, the <a href="https://github.com/PinguinoBase/Pinguino-Base-4550">Pinguino Base 4550 board</a>
was choosen to be the first prototype. We built one (the board on the photo following this text), and tested it.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
We presented the Pinguino Base 4550 board to the Educational Robotics Group, and were asked to reduce the boards size if possible, so
as to diminish its overall cost and use of PCB. We modified the circuit schematics to reduce costs by decreasing its total size and 
removing the ICSP headers. The modified boards were called "PinguinoUCAB".

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Two prototypes of the PinguinoUCAB boards were built before a major economic unforeseen situation totally reduced the Educational Robotics
Group funds for the project.

Without funds, we agreed with the Educational Robotics Group to dedicate ourselves to produce a video tutorial describing the construction
process so that the boards could be easily reproduced by the members of the Educational Robotics Group.

A set of touch sensors, transistor-based DC motor control circuits and Light-Detection-Resistances was arranged on a PCB to test the Pinguino 
boards and serve as the first prototype of a low-cost learn-electronics-with-pinguino kit that is going to be developed in the future by the 
Educational Robotics Group. Finally, we wrote manuals for building and programming the boards,
